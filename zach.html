<h1><b><center> STAYING POSITIVE IN A NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENT </center> <b></h1>
<p lock> In checking today's world we will see that teenagers in the slum are easily influenced with the bad example in the environment.All because their parent was not able to give the write parenting.
Most parents in my region (oko agbon) believe as children grows they will get to figure out themselves no need to tell them anything, later the years the parent will see such child and won't be happy with them,
some years back but now we are seeing parent complying with this method of bringing up child who are well trained and well equipped in our societies
<br> <br>The major problem faced by these children is mostly from peer presure, they always want to do what every other everybody is doing, which is bringing
about those children doing the unexpected in the environment e.g stealing their mum money, yahoo boys ( you get right) and all others. So for us to bring things
to order we need to first work on the parent and then enlighten the young on the steps to take and how to excel. </center></p>

<p> From time we've seen parent who use abusive words on their children e.g like causing them and comparing them to their friends which as put bad experience <br> on this
children, i have learnt with time that children don't easily forget bad words spoken to them while they grow into adult so also the good words, those word create a large 
mark on such to remember always, so as parent let learn to speak the write to our children because those words we say can make them or destroy them, this remind me of a
young girl in my community who got pregnated at a early age and she let school to take futher treatment on her, by god grace after nine months she gave birth and start 
nurturing her child, with the help of her parent after some parent the parent said they can't continue with these that she had to go to her husband house, this brought
alot of sorrow to her but she doesn't have a choice she had to go, so after a couple of she was stranted and couldn't afford anything she had to dtart coming back to her
parent to beg for bread, why am i qouteing this story because it taught me alot of lesson in life e.g<br>
</body>

<ul> 
	<li> Don't get into what you are not prepared for. </li>
	<li> Learn to listen to people who are older than you are because their counsel brings lighting. </li>
	<li> Learn to be outspoken, when things are wrong don't keep them to yourself tell a trusted adult and speak to. </li>
	<li> In whatever area you are in life, learn to stay focus minding your business. </li>
</ul>

<h2><b><center>THE ROLE OF PARENT IN CHILD'S GROWTH</center></b></h2>
<p> Parent most times get it wrong in bringing up their children, the father will think the growth of the child is only dependent on the mum
	while the mum also will all the financing in the house is for only the dad, which is a very wrong mindset.<br> So we are writing this to
	bring enlighten to parent how they ought to cooperate to bring the best out of their child. In todays world we will see alot of teenage
	pregnacy around the reason be that those children were not informed about the stage they are going to before they came in, so many parents
	find it irritating to give their children sex talk but later the child will find the wrong perspective of it from it and continue in that 
	manner before the parents could know it already pregnacy. So parent will need to first show their children the very best example of what
	they want their children become, if you don’t want your child do some certain things don’t do it in her presence because the moment she start 
	seeing you do it, now or later she will do same.<br> Before i continue i will love to tell you a story of what happened in my own community
	(Oko-Agbon) their live a rich man in the community when i was very young this parent love their children alot and get the best for them but 
	their was a problem with these parents which is they don’t have a specific goal for their children future, so as they grew they found themselves
	doing nothing, the rich lost his job till today it has being hard on the well being of the family, so what am i trying to bring out of this let
	try to bring our children to the world space so that they can find something and let learn to teach our children the right moral when they are 
	young so that when they grew it will become a easy life for them.<br>  We have alot going on in this country, so if want your child to stand out amonng his friends in learning new ideaology
	and working on it to get better click the link below.
